This is a skeleton you can use to start your projects

## Overview

This project contains code for `shopcarts` microservice. The `/service` folder contains your `models/` folder for our models and a `routes.py` file for the `shopcarts` service. The `/tests` folder has test cases for testing the model and the service separately. You can simply start the testing process once you clone the repository and reopen it in the container. After that is done, please run

```bash
pytest
```

To see all the tests passing.
